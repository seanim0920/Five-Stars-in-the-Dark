    Removed unneeded print statement
    Realized the next dialogue could start at the same moment the current dialogue ends, so a >= is included to check for that, in the line that would allow the dialogue to continue onto the last section without pausing indefinitely

    Fixed bug where the passenger hurt sound and level dialogue would play at the same time. Now Constructlevel waits before any hurt sounds are finished playing (from the PlayError script) before resuming the dialogue after a stopping obstacle is passed.
    Attempted to fix bug where target car WOULDNT pass you and would just repeatedly hit you if you were in front of it

    PlayError now checks if the dialogue was paused previously before resuming it (so it doesn't resume the dialogue when it should've been paused, for obstacles like the quickturn or stoplight)
    Moved a line in constructlevel that paused the dialogue when a stopping obstacle was spawned just to avoid unexpected behavior
    Stoplights are made a little more forgiving

    Slowed down Target car so player can catch up with it
    Made separate method for car parking at the end of the level in an attempt to fix bug where car would keep rumbling/stay zoomed in after the level ends

    Settings now carry over across scenes
    
    - This is done just by using static classes
    - I was overthinking Singletons, I think
    - Hopefully this doesn't bite me in the butt
    - Each level's settings panel needs to hook up their toggles to the levelconstructor in the onValue changed part
    - Added quit button on Pause menu too. Hopefully it works

    - Still need to turn settings into singleton so that volume sliders are consistent throughout playthrough
    - Still need to be able to change controllers on the fly
    - Also need to update button highlights
    - Pause options are slightly smaller due to scaling with proper resolution now

    Car-related failure dialogue has been implemented, but still in-progress
    
    - Added CoC AudioSource to NPC Audio mixer
    - Added GenericObstacleFailure script to every car prefab except stoplight cars
    - stoplight cars have the PlayStoplightFailure script instead
    - It seems the failure dialogue is still tied to the obstacles' audio source
    - LevelConstructor will need to resume dialogue after the failure dialogue gets played because depending on the length of the dialogue clip, both dialogues can be running at the same time
    - Fixed bug where game crashes after obstacle<AudioSource> despawns while still colliding with the player's proximity detector
    - Added GenericCrash audio folder under each level's failure folder
    - Added Stoplight audio folder under level 3 and 4 failure folder (They just use the hurry generic dialogue atm)

    PauseMenu now checks whether it paused the dialogue before resuming it. If it didn't pause the dialogue, it won't resume it (so the dialogue can be paused and resumed from other scripts).
    Quickturns, stoplights and target cars now pause the dialogue until they are destroyed. Stoplight will need to be adjusted to destroy itself after the player crosses it.
    CarCollision pauses dialogue during a collision now, rather than stopping it, and tag comparisons use CompareTag function now since according to Unity that's more efficient.

    CheckLosing, audiosources and cardooropen.wav added to Score Singleton to play the losing cutscene
    TrackErrors.IncrementErrorsAndUpdateDisplay() -> TrackErrors.IncrementErrors
    Moved failure dialogues from Resources/Audio to their respective Level folder
    static "errortext" variable in ErrorCountDisplay made non-static
    Removed UI and SceneManagement libraries from TrackErrors and CountdownTimer and moved its losing condition code to CheckLosing
    ShutOff() in PlayerControls (for when the player loses) now disables controls
    Other things changed in level 1 idk what
    Reference to CountdownTimer removed from Levelconstructor (it now calls a static method)
    Removed unused variables from TrackErrors

    Decoupled the error/time tracking code from the error/time tracking text. Error and time tracking are now in the score singleton, rather than being children of the camera.
    ErrorCountDisplay and TimeTrackerDisplay put into ErrorText and TimerText in the main camera to display the errors/time from the score singleton
    Removed reference to countdowntimer from constructlevel, now it calls a static function in countdowntimer
    CheckErrors -> TrackErrors
    Errors made into a float to allow partial errors for minor collisions
    Variable included in CountdownTimer to toggle whether it's tracking time or not
    Idk what happened in level 2

    Special Failure Dialogue
    
    Dialogue will play when the player fails the level before transitioning to the fail screen.
    
    Currently only plays a specific clip for Rosales, functionality for chosing the correct fail based on level and context has not been implemented.
    
    May behave incorrectly if the player finishes the level while the fail dialogue is playing or manages to get 11 errors while the fail dialogue is playing.

    PlayerControls - In strafe function, a turnFail coroutine is ran if the player tries turning while PlayerControls is disabled. It is meant to run once at a time.
    Tidied up the strafe function to merge the movement script and the curb collision script into a single block of code.

    Merge Tweaks
    
    - Had to rename Canvas object only in level 1 for some reason (dunno why the changes to the prefab didn't update on level 1)
    - Scaled up Quick Turn prefab so that players enter the sequence faster
    - *Potential Bug* Quick Turns disable player movement when you're in this sequence. This causes the steering wheel to return to neutral and might give off the impression that the player's controller has stopped working

    New Score Algorithm
    
    Scores are now set as so:
    Score = 100 - (errors * 8) - ((time-par)/600), where time is how long the player took, and par is the fastest they could have beaten the level.
    
    Due to a bug somewhere in LevelConstructor, level progress ins't being saved correctly, so DisplayScore gets confused on what value to give the Stars. This change can't be pushed until that bug is fixed.
    
    Also, reduced engine noise by 50% for coasting and braking(?), and 33% for accelerating.

    Main Canvas in Main Camera renamed to Canvas again to be compatible with the score script
    The pause button and pause canvas are in the main camera prefab
    The pause menu grabs all playing audiosources and stops/resumes them now
    In constructlevelfrommarkers, checkifspeaking() is removed and isspeaking is just a public static variable now
    Code to pause the level dialogue and play the passenger hurt sound is reworked in CarCollsion so the leveldialogue is stopped and started rather than paused and resumed, to prevent glitches from colliding with the pause menu's global pausing and resuming of audiosources
    CarCollision finds levelconstructor automatically rather than having to hook it up every time now.

    - Failscreen progress bar works and is dependent on the score singleton's progress variable
    - Endscreen score bar also works, but I think the way that the score is calculated needs to be tweaked (For instance, what's the max score/required score to reach 5 stars in each individual leve?)

    Remembered what change was made to the player in the previous commit: Turned gamepad controls off by default
    Enginestart sound object was removed in player, now the level constructor script plays the engine starting sound itself
    Black screen reference made from a gameobject to image in level constructor to allow black screen fading; reference was changed to an image instead of a gameobject in the levels
    Level constructor should disable player controls at the end of the level now, and can play a car parking sound (currently using car starting sound as a placeholder)

    Police Car Misc. Adjustments
    
    - FastCar prefab has some changes that I cannot recall and cannot decipher
    (All I remember is changing the engine sound to the police siren sound for testing purposes)
    - PoliceCars now have the doppler effect turned off (set to 0) in order to get rid of the siren beeping
    - Increased MinDistance and MaxDistance on police siren's audio source
    - PoliceCar class now inherits from NPCMovement, however there are errors that reference private vairables that are already serialized (this doesn't seem to break anything though)

    - Gave PoliceCars a capsuleCollider to make level constructor happy
    - Raised siren volume (it's still relatively quiet for me tho)
    - Raised PoliceCars' eyesight range
    - Added check to see if Raycast hits a game object with "player" tag

    Gamepad controls
    
    - Gamepad can use right trigger to accelerate
    - acceleration is dependent on how hard the player is pulling the trigger
    - Gamepad can use left trigger to brake
    - how hard the player brakes depends on how hard the player is pulling the trigger as well
    - Gamepad can use left joystick to strafe left/right
    - strafe amount is dependent on how far the stick is being tilted
    
    To Do:
    - Separate gamepad controls from Player Control script
    - Add quick turn functionality
    - Disable all other control types if using a Gamepad
    - (Optional) rename PS4Controls script to GamepadControls

    NPC cars use capsule colliders now, for the left/right detection to have a smoother auditory transition

    You must pass in the KeyboardControl and PlayerControls scripts to the QuickTurn prefab and set the boolean that determines whether the player must turn left or right after you place the prefab onto the scene. Commented out SwitchLanes implementation bc it was the source of the game crashing. You can see how quick turn works in the testlevel scene (Make sure you don't collide with cars and keep an eye out in the console for instructions)

    Dialogue Interrupts
    
    Dialogue will now be interrupted with the passenger saying 'oof' or something whenever there is a collision. Dialgoue resumes 3 seconds later.
    
    Issues:
    Uses the same clip every time because I can't figure out char to int conversions and C#
    Reverts back to the previous marker outlined in LevelConstructor, which is usually really far back, sounds weird
    Pause before dialogue restarts is amplified by dead air at the beginning of dialogue
    Doesn't work with guardrails, because guardrails don't have a collision sound (and thus break the collision script)
    
    All of these things need to be fixed, but fall outside the scope of this task, so I haven't fixed them.

    DialogueInterrupt Development
    
    Added functionality to interrupt whoever is talking if the player crashes. Currently, it waits 3 seconds after crash then rewinds back to the last dialogue marker.

    C# Script Sorting
    
    Sorted the scripts into subfolders in /Scripts. If a script is just in/Scripts, I'm not sure what it does or where it should go. Feel free to reorganize stuff if I put it in the wrong place.

    Doppler Improvments
    
    Set cars to have a doppler level of 5 and have a 2-25 custom rolloff (3rd key = (16, 0.059), 4th key = (25, 0).
    
    The doppler effect is mostly dependent on the difference in speed between the two objects.  The effect can be magnified further, but it'll start to sound weird.

    Improved Obstacle Panning
    
    Cars now pan on a 2-10 (or 50 depending on speed) linear rolloff
    Guardrails will pan to the left or right full depending on their position relative to the car.
    
    This involved noticible changes to the CarCollision script, specifically how it handle audio.

    dialogues.aup and dialogues_data -> level1dialogues.aup and level1dialogues_data
    removed unnecessary audacity project files
    made audio file "gps_middle", "gps_start", "gps_end"
    remade the slowcar and fastcar prefabs to have an activation zone and use their rigidbodies instead of collision triggers
    included new sprites for npc cars
    "Activator" script enables NPC car movement when player gets close to one
    made radio volume duck under static and radio/static volume duck under dialogue through audiomixers instead of by code
    made GPS marker prefab that simply holds an audio file and plays it when the player passes by
    made exit prefab that plays a "you've reached your destination" sound effect and takes the player to the endscreen
    included a function that resets static volume to 0 in proximity script
    removed collision code in PlayerControls and moved it to CarCollision script
    constructlevelfrommarkers script:
    -moves player to beginning of the road
    -places GPS markers on the road as well, and includes a "Construct Level" function in the script's context menu (right-click script in the inspector)
    -moved adjustinstrumentvolume function to end as it's no longer used to duck the volume of the radio
    -included functions in playcutscenes to start the car and turn the black screen off at the appropriate times (will need to be made cleaner)
    reduced screen shake when going fast in SpeedShake script
    changed curb prefab to use rigidbody instead of collision trigger
    changed size of road sprite
    made npc engines louder (but they still aren't super noticeable)
    other changes to level 1 that I can't remember

    Added screen shake when speeding, added curb object in lieu of tilemapped curbs, removed tilemaps and spawned curbs at the start instead, proximity uses a hotbox instead of raycasting to distinguish left/right incoming sounds, preparing audiomixers to hook up proximity sound so ducking is controlled by unity instead of manually with code, carcollision script checks new level constrution script instead of old cutscene script for dialogue events

    Timers and End Screens
    
    Updated the timer scripts including some of the end screen and scoring scripts since the time functionality was not working. Also, re-added the multiple ways to get to the end screen (time runs out, 10 errors, or end of script is reached). For some reason, all time is moving twice as fast as it should, but I have taken that into account when tracking and displaying time (by doubling the level and wait times and by halving the remaining time on the display screen). Also, tweaked some timing on the conversation script, but the news audio is not playing, so that will need to be looked into.

    Remade cutscene script into ConstructLevelFromMarkers, which, given an audio file and a text file with labels, pauses and plays the dialogue at appropriate times with adjustable wait times.
    Pressing "s" skips to the next piece of dialogue.
    Made spawning distance adjustable for "SpawnCarInFrontOfPlayer" script.
    Edited car start sound to include keys turning before starting car
    Black screen in Level 1 is off by default
    NPC's max speed is now dependent on its neutral speed rather than being fixed (now neutralspeed + 0.1)
    Instrument order adjusted when moving fast
    Side Collision Force included in Steering Wheel Control. Spring force adjusted to have a weaker max, but act more constantly.
    
    Removed some accidental junk files (Quick access - Shortcut and bass_data.meta)
    
    Included a fastcar/slowcar variant to be spawned.
    Included a text file marking each time characters speak in the level.
    Included a text file marking each section of dialogue in the level.
    Included audacity project with complete level dialogue and markers
    Included complete level dialogue audio file
    
    Bug: CountdownTimer does not display time now for some reason.

    GPS Audio
    
    Re-added GPS audio queues to Level 1. Plays "Starting route" right after the Part 1 audio, then plays "1000 ft" after the Part 5 audio, and finally plays "You have reached your destination" right after the Part 6 audio.  Also relabeled some of the gps audio files.  Revised the cutscene script to include the GPS audio.

    Menu script to check the player's controller to show the appropriate control scheme (not functional currently)
    Cutscenes.cs:
    -Added method in Cutscene script to check whether dialogue is currently playing
    -News broadcast interrupts radio music now (although very sloppily)
    -Certain instruments are lowered when dialogue is playing
    -In the game, only a specific section of the song (where all the instruments play) is looped (will consider progressing the song to the next section after a dialogue plays)
    LowPassDetection.cs:
    -Hearingdistance -> 2.3f, maxvolume -> 20f to attempt to give players more of a warning about the left/right edges
    script controlling menu music start time commented out
    end screen adjusted to add margins to the edges and remove currently non-functional features and look less cluttered
    layout of the menu screen adjusted somehow, forgot how.
    random hurt dialogue plays when smacking into obstacles, when dialogue is not playing
    DisplayScore.cs fills the final score meter when the end cutscene finishes
    strafing by keyboard made less sensitive
    NPCs honk when behind player
    more instruments play the faster player goes (Still unclear/distracting for players)
    two different angled rays used to check a car in front of player (should use collider instead)
    ScoreNumber fixed, uses displayscore instead of old progressbar script name

    Altered acceleration/deceleration to be dependent on a parameter (will later further change so the harder you hit gas, the faster you reach top speed)
    NPC engine pitch no longer changes, so it won't interfere with the doppler effect
    In PlayerControls: Renamed "invalidDirection" variable to "blockedSide", radio tempo (not pitch) adjusts now according to speed
    movement speed altered so there is no distinction between slowing down to neutral and slowing down to a full stop
    strafe sound is made louder
    "setradiotempo" function made because unity doesn't have one built in for some darn reason
    Proximity previously only checked directly in front of the player for cars, now it checks the width of the car with two rays
    Cars now only spawn directly in front of the player
    Function to play frontal collision made in Steering Wheel Control

    Control1D -> PlayerControls
    NPC's speed wasn't adjusting properly; neutralSpeed, not movementSpeed, was meant to be adjustable; it is now.
    Shrunk distance NPC cars can be heard (20 -> 3) and used a linear rolloff so they can't be heard past the max distance (logarithmic rolloff has this quirk)
    Popped in Brian's end screen
    Returned LoadScene script because it got removed previously
    Temp. guardrail collision sfx script until we can implement Thomas' system
    Strafing is dampened when using a keyboard, and eventually returns to a neutral state
    NPC's movement direction is checked in update now so it can change directions when rotated
    proximity sound is now static, and volume adjusts according to distance from car
    ActiveZone is now triggered by player contact; cars spawn in front of the player until an adjustable max amount is reached, and turn away after leaving the ActiveZone. Cars leaving the zone are replaced.
    SteeringWheelControl script now initializes the steering wheel. Apparently this is necessary at the start to get it actually working
    SteeringWheelImageRotation script moved from player to Canvas
    AudioListener moved from camera to player (first-person [kinda] perspective)
    Music now plays on both sides; when the player approaches the guardrail, a low pass filter is applied to the corresponding side and its volume amped up, creating an exaggerated "muffled sound" effect (In LowPassDetection script in player object)
    Two audiosources to play music from the left and right, and corresponding audiomixers to filter each source
    A script to play the voices and switch between the different voice actors was included (disabled)
    Strafe noises are played on the opposite side you're strafing, and their volume adjusts accordingly

    Level 1 Design
    
    I've developed the Level 1 Scene to the point where it fits the general outline provided in the Level Design outlines. More specific tuning may be required to specifically fit the dialogue or timing desired. Score generation does not seem to be working as the script is missing. The current level outline in Unity looks like: Stopped (30 sec) -> Moving (15~25 sec) -> Traffic (15~25 sec) -> Turn (basic right/left side of the road) -> Moving (15~25 sec) ->Traffic (15~25 sec) -> Turn (basic right/left side of the road) -> End of level

Maximum score from time set to 2 stars. These could be modified and set to variables to reflect variable diffuculty of a level. Curently, countdown timer displays over the black screen to allow visibility during optimal play. Audio queues could be helpful to remind players of time.

    Also added a blackout panel so prototypes that use cameras smaller than the screen don't have menu assets in the background.

    Additional Menu Functionality
    
    Added a script that makes buttons (or other things) load new scenes.
    
    A bit janky on 5th prototype due to that scene's camera not taking up the entire screen.

    Been working on tracking Errors and displaying them. Still having some trouble since the text keeps drawing onto itself. Added in a message that appears when you complete the level, but I still have not implemented the number of score (out of 5) for each level nor the level complete screen.

    Menu Development
    
    Added a Menu scene that will eventually hold the main menu. The buttons don't really do anything, but the UI elements are all there.
    
    Also added MenuTesting.cs, which is a simple script that pings the console. I'm using it to make sure buttons actually do things when pressed.

    added ui text for error tracking, but it sits behind the tilemap. Forgot to mention the previous commit also added a proximity sensor to detect things directly in front of the car

    Occlusion through Unity Audio Spatialization
    
    Unity's built-in audio system allows us to create spatial audio without the need for scripts, which includes more realistic panning and a basic occlusion.
    
    Changes:
    -Disabled Audio 1D on NPC Prefab
    -Enabled Spatialization on NPC Prefab
    -Set NPC Audio Source SpatialBlend to 3D and Volume to 1
    -Set NPC Audio Source rolloff to a 1-10 linear rolloff
    
    The rolloff controls the distance at which panning takes place. Should absolutely be different, this is just a good number for making sure it works.
